Frogger

This program is my attempt at Frogger using Java and Eclipse. All work is done by myself and the game is fully functional with sound, start screen, game over screen,
and high score list.

## Beginning of the Game ##
The user begins as the dark green square located at the bottom center of the screen.<br />
The longer multi-colored rectangles are the vehicles which the user has to avoid, if they get hit by one, 
then a "squish" sound is played, and the user loses points and a life.<br />
Every vehicle is going in random directions (either left or right)<br />
The user's objective is to reach all 5 lily pads before losing all lives<br />
Vehicle speed increases greatly after every lily pad reached<br />
